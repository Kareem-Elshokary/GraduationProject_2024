# Design and Development of an Autonomous Self-parking Car

## üìå Overview
This project presents the design and development of an autonomous self-parking system capable of detecting suitable parking spaces, selecting the appropriate parking type (parallel or perpendicular), and executing the parking and exit maneuvers automatically. It integrates Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) concepts to enhance safety, reduce human error, and improve parking efficiency in tight urban environments.

## üß† Features
- Automatic detection of parking spaces.
- Smart decision-making for choosing parking strategy.
- Smooth and safe maneuvering using non-holonomic kinematic constraints.
- Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance.
- Full software architecture including MCAL, HAL, and Application Layer.
- Real-time scheduling using RTOS.
- MATLAB-based simulation and validation.
