# Design and Development of an Autonomous Self-parking Car

## Project Description:
The goal of the self-parking system is to park the car efficiently, perpendicular/parallel to the curb, within the smallest available parking space and without the risk of collision.

## Contributions
My work on this project centered around the development of the core self-parking logic.  Specifically:
  **Kinematic Equations:** Developed a set of kinematic equations that accurately model the car's motion, accounting for steering angle, speed, and other relevant parameters. This mathematical model is crucial for    precise path planning and control.
  **Path Planning Algorithm:** Created and implemented the algorithm responsible for generating appropriate parking paths, handling both parallel and perpendicular parking scenarios.
  **Verification and Validation:** Integrated and tested the system, verifying the connection between kinematic equations and the application for self-parking functionality.
